We present a ``Physics-Informed Machine-Learning`` method for the approximation of ``Slow Invariant Manifolds`` of ``Singularly Perturbed Systems``, providing  functionals in an explicit form that facilitate the construction and numerical integration of reduced order models (ROMs).
We use ``Feedforward Neural Networks`` (FNNs) and ``Random Projection Neural Networks`` (RPNNs) to solve the PDE corresponding to the ``Invariance Equation`` (IE) within the ``Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory`` (GSPT) framework.

The efficiency the scheme is compared with analytic SIM approximation provided by the well-established GSPT methods of IE and ``Computational Singular Perturbation``.
